# Automated Archive

In our unstable world everything happens. So best way to do, is to be prepared.<br>
This repository accumulate scripts to automate drivers/firmwares/tools download from well known companies.<br>
<br>
Internet is not forever, so when it would be turned off, backups of this important data would be in demand.<br>
This repo contains only scripts, without data. All data you should download by yourself on alienable backup.<br>
<br>
All scripts supports download resuming.
